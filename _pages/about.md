My name is Christian Drischler. I'm an Assistant Professor of Physics and [FRIB](https://frib.msu.edu/) Bridge Faculty at the [Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (INPP)](https://inpp.ohio.edu/~inpp/) at [Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/). I'm also an elected member of the [FRIB Theory Alliance Executive Board](https://www.fribtheoryalliance.org/content/executive_board.php). 

My research is at the intersection of theoretical nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics. I'm using microscopic methods to shed light on strongly interacting, dense matter in the universe.

My current research interests include:
* Neutron stars
* Equation of state of neutron-rich matter
* Chiral effective field theory
* Many-body perturbation theory
* Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification
* Emulators for nuclear physics and model (order) reduction
* Computational physics

I'm collaborating with:
* NSF-funded Physics Frontier Center _Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries_ ([N3AS](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/))
* _Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification: Errors in Your EFT_ ([BUQEYE](https://buqeye.github.io/)) collaboration,
* NSF-funded _Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics_ ([BAND](https://bandframework.github.io/)) Framework, and
* DOE-funded _SmarT Reduction and Emulation Applying Machine Learning In Nuclear Environment_ (STREAMLINE) collaboration.

> Don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in a Research Fellowship of the [Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/) (such as the [Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship)) hosted by me at Ohio University.
