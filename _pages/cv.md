Students are introduced to numerical methods and the process of approaching scientific problems from a computational point of view. Topics covered include:

* numerical differentiation and integration methods,
* numerical error analysis,
* numerical linear algebra,
* data fitting,
* Monte Carlo strategies, and
* parallel computing.
